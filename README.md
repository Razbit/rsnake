rsnake
======

Razbit's snake-ish game

How to build & run?
---------------------

Unfortunately, no Windows support at this moment. Feel free to contact me, if you have a viable solution for getting curses working on Windows.

UNIX -derivatives:
- Make sure you have g++, make and ncurses (libncurses-dev) installed. Then run inside the rsnake directory:

make

When make completes, a file called rsnake should have appeared. You can copy it where ever you like, for example (as root):

cp rsnake /usr/local/bin/

Now you can run the game by typing:

rsnake
